				<h1>Email Someone Money</h1>
				<p>This form allows you to send us a Ripple transfer in CAD, after which we will send an Interac e-Transfer to the destination email address (less a 2 CAD fee).  Your email address (which might be the same, if you're sending money to yourself) is needed so that we can contact you if anything goes wrong (such as if the recipient fails to accept the e-Transfer).  <strong>Make sure your recipient knows this transfer is coming from us, and what the secret answer is.</strong></p>

				<p>This service is limited to {{serviceLimit}} CAD per user per day.</p>

				<p>After submitting this form, you will be given a destination tag to use in your transaction, so that we can link it to this request.</p>

				<p>Please allow up to 2 business days for processing.</p>
