			<h1>Transfer to IOUs</h1>
			<p>This form allows you to send us an Interac e-Transfer, after which we will send CAD IOUs to your Ripple address, less a 2 CAD fee.  If necessary, your account will be activated with XRP and you will receive an email from our staff with further instructions.</p>

			<p>This service is limited to {{serviceLimit}} CAD per user per day.</p>

			<p>An automated service will verify your telephone number shortly after you submit this form.  You will then be given a unique email address to send the e-Transfer to.  In some cases, our staff may also call you to further verify your identity and may ask for your birth date and/or mailing address.</p>

			<p>Please allow up to 2 business days for processing.</p>

			<p>Telephone number must be a full 10-digit North American number.</p>
